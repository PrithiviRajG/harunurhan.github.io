## About
I am a Computer Engineering student (finished the degree but offically will gradute in June 2017) from Turkey and I work at CERN, live near to Geneva, Switzerland.

I am interested in distributed systems, big data, sql engines, reactive programming..., so always open to job offers for these areas :)

Apart from my job, I am committing to [Presto](http://prestodb.io) in my free time, a distributed sql engine, which was initially developed at Facebook. Now used in production by [many big companies](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/wiki/Presto-Users) and being developed by engineers from most of these companies.

Also, I like to try and learn new things/technologies/languagues and contribute to other open source projects.
